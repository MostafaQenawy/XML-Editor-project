# XML Editor_project

## Discription
This project aims to develop a GUI-based program to parse, visualize, and analyze XML files representing users in a social network. The tool performs various operations on XML data, ensuring consistency, formatting, conversion to JSON, compression, and graph-based network analysis.

## Introduction
XML (Extensible Markup Language) serves as a fundamental format for data exchange among devices. This project targets the development of a robust GUI program capable of handling XML files representing social network users. By parsing and visualizing this data, the tool offers insights into network structures and supports various transformations of the XML content.

## Features
  #### 1. XML Consistency Check: Detects and resolves inconsistencies in XML files.
2. XML Formatting: Ensures well-formatted XML through indentation.
3. XML to JSON Conversion: Transforms XML data into JSON format.
4. XML Minification: Reduces file size by removing whitespaces and newlines.
5. Data Compression: Implements an ad-hoc compression technique for file size reduction.
6. Graph Representation: Utilizes a graph data structure to depict user relations within the network.
7. Network Analysis: Identifies influential and active users, mutual followers, and suggests users to follow.
8. Post Search: Enables searching for specific words/topics within posts.
9. Graph Visualization: Utilizes third-party libraries/tools for visualizing the network graph.
10. Undo/Redo Operations: Implements functionality for reverting or reapplying changes made during editing.
